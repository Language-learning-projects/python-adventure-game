# Python adventure game

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Python adventure game".

It's purpose is to build a text-based adventure game with room, inventory, combat, puzzle solving and game saving functionality.

## Idea

A text-based adventure game that uses various algorithms and data structures to create an immersive experience. The game should use a graph data structure to represent the rooms, and a stack or queue to manage the playerâ€™s inventory. For combat, if included, a binary search tree or heap could be used to manage health points. Puzzles in the game could involve sorting, searching, or pathfinding algorithms. File I/O operations should be used to save and load the game state.

## Learning

- Python
- Graph
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary search tree/heap
- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms
- Pathfinding algorithms
- I/O operations

## Requirements

- A player must be able to move rooms using the up, down, left and right keywords.
- Each room must tell the player what monsters and items there are.
- A player must be able to attack a monster.
- A player must be able to pick up an item.
- An item must have a chance of being a trap that steals health points or items.
- Each room movement must have some lore which influences the game. Examples coud be stronger monsters, higher chance of a trap or the requirement of certain items. (It's gone pretty dark. Use a flashlight to continue.)
- Each action must have a response. (The mushroom zombie has been slain. You lost 10 health points. 17/100 remaining.)
- A player must be able to run player commands like hp, inventory, attack and use item 1.
- Some room movements must have puzzles that the user needs to solve before continuing.
